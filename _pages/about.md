Welcome to my persoanl website! :blush:

- I am currently the MSc student from Intelligent Building Technology and Managment Program of HKUST. I received my B.Eng. degree in College of Civil and Transportation Engineering at Shenzhen University in 2022.
- My current research interest is the performance analysis of Photovoltaic Integrated Green Roof (PVIGR) Systems and the simulation of its impact on urban climate. Additionally, I hold a keen interest in data analysis and machine learning.
- My broad interests focus on urban climate, smart city, sustainable development. :house_with_garden: :chart_with_upwards_trend: :recycle:
- I look forward to communicating with you all.
